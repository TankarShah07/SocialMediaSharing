Description

There are several restrictions on social media platforms and due to that we are not able to share complete content 
which we actually willing to share.
So, SocialMediaSharing is an one stop social media sharing project. 
Just tap on sharing option and your content will be shared on social platform with just one simple click.

So here I have created 1 single project which combine 3 popular sharing media
1. Facebook
2. Twitter
3. Instagram

So just simply use code written inside action event and you are done.

How to use Social Media Sharing

1) Clone/Download repository
2) Go to info.plist file and add your facebook app id (if you want to use facebook sharing) and twitter app consumer key and consumer secret (if you want to use twitter sharing)
3) open terminal and provide your path and hit enter (e.g. open terminal â€”> cd path/xyz/SocialMediaSharing)
4) pod install
